# The Nevermore Hotel

## Lesson

This was a final project that drew frome everything we learned for the past 6 weeks in Mod 2 at Turing.  The main focuses were SASS, jQuery, inheritance and OOP, and the Fetch API request.

## Setup

Simply clone down the repo, and run npm install to make sure that you have the correct dependencies.  Run npm start to initialize the app, and go to `http://localhost:8080/` to see it.




### Prompt:

### JavaScript

You have to be very intentional with where you add your feature code. This repo uses a tool called [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to combine many JavaScript files into one big file. Webpack enables you to have many, separate JavaScript files to keep your code organized and readable. Webpack expects all of your code files to be in a specific place, or else it doesn't know how to combine them all behind the scenes.

**Create all of your feature code files in the `src` directory.**

Since code is separated into multiple files, you need to use the `import` and `export` syntax to share code across file.

Here is a video that walks through some information about [import and export](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3oSWwapPKQ). There are a lot of resources out there about `import` and `export`, and resources will sometimes call them `ES6 modules`. It's something you will see in React and beyond.

### HTML

Add the HTML you need in the `index.html` file in the `./src` directory. There is some boilerplate HTML that exists from the start that you can modify.

### CSS (SCSS/SASS)

This project is setup to use SCSS/SASS files by default instead of your regular CSS files. Add your SCSS files in the `src/css` directory. There is a `base.scss` file already there, but you can change this file and add multiple SCSS files in this directory.

This might sound weird, but you need to `import` your SCSS files in the JavaScript entry file (`index.js`) for the styles to be applied to your HTML. The example `base.scss` file has already been imported in the JavaScript entry file as an example.


## Deploying to GitHub Pages

_If you are finished with the functionality and testing of your project_, then you can consider deploying your project to the web! This way anyone can play it without cloning down your repo.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to deploy your project to the web. Don't worry about this until your project is free of bugs and well tested!

If you _are_ done, you can follow [this procedure](./gh-pages-procedure.md) to get your project live on GitHub Pages.
